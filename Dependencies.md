### Core Dependencies
**Q:  Is jQuery a core package?**
Sortof.  It's a dependency of Spark, and is included in pretty much all core applications.  In the new [Blaze UI, jQuery is used for event handling](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Using-Blaze#events-use-jquery). Assume it's a core package.

**Q:  I'm looking in myapp/.meteor/packages, and I don't see jQuery listed.  Why does my app act like it's loading jQuery?**
Because it's a dependency of Spark.  It's a hidden dependency.  `myapp/.meteor/packages` is not a definitive list of dependencies.  Just the most immediate dependencies.

### Dependency Load Ordering

Something that really trips people up a lot with Meteor is load ordering and dependencies, particularly if they're accustomed to sequential or imperative style programming (i.e. coming from object-oriented languages and frameworks).  When it comes to the ordering and sequence of events, there are two phases.  First, there's the bundling of resource.  During bundling, as Meteor prepares your application for deployment, it gathers up all your resources and files, and puts them into a bundle according to rules on how **it** thinks things should be ordered.  So, the first step to getting load ordering right, is to learn to adjust your file directories and naming schemas to fit with the Meteor bundler.

The simple rule of thumb is that the bundler includes files in the deepest directories first (see following example).  You'll note that this bundling order has specifically influenced our previous discussion on 'where should we put files?'

````js
// the bundling process output is such that libraries in the deepest directories will be loaded first
/client/lib/deepest/folder/library.js
/client/lib/deeper/library.js
/client/lib/library.js

// and libraries in the root directory will be loaded last
/client/library.js

// meteor then bundles and deploys
````

### 3rd Party Libraries

**Q:  How do I add dependencies?**
If you haven't run across Meteorite and Atmosphere and the mrt command utility, do some research on those terms.  In the /usr/loca/meteor/packages directory, you'll find all the source code for the packages themselves, and take a gander at the package.js files.  Those, in conjunction with the 'meteor add package-name' syntax is how Meteor handles much of the dependency type stuff.  Of course, the dependency management requires that a package is built in the first place.

**Q: How do I get a 3rd-party-library.js to work with Meteor?**

Installing a 3rd party library doesn't have to be hard.  If you're having problems, it's probably because the reactive templates are overwriting the objects you created.  There are a few ways to deal with this:

1.  Move your code out of reactive templates.  Autorun() is a good event hook for creating objects in.

    ```js
    Deps.autorun(function(){
        // the timeline object is outside the scope of any reactive templates
        timeline = new Timeline();
    });
    ```


2.  check to see if your object already exists
    ```js
    Template.templateWithConstantRegion.rendered = function(){
      // we simply add feature detection to see if the object already exists
      self.node = self.find("#timelineObject");
      if (! self.handle) {
        // don't get worked up about this Deps.autorun()
        // it's an option addition to this pattern
        self.handle = Deps.autorun(function(){
            Timeline();
        });
      };
    };

    // don't forget to complete the pattern by tearing down the object properly
    Template.templateWithConstantRegion.destroyed = function () {
      this.handle && this.handle.stop();
    };
    ```

3.  use a ``#constant`` region or a ``Template.frontPage.preserve()`` callback
    ```html
    <temlate name="templateWithConstantRegion">
      <div>
        {{#constant}}
          <div id="timelineObject"></div>
        {{/contant}}
      </div>
    </template>
    ```


4.  You'll also want to check for `var` keywords in your library.  Unlike most other Javascript frameworks, Meteor uses the 'var' keyword in a very specific way to restrict the scope of a variable to a single file.  So, many libraries will use the 'var' keyword to simply define a variable to the global scope; but Meteor will interpret the 'var' to mean a variable specific to the local file.  This causes problems sometimes.

    ````js
    // variable restricted to local file
    var foo = 42;

    // variable shared between files
    foo = 42;

    // bad; function restricted to local scope
    // source of lots of frustration and broken applications
    var createStoryJS = function (){ ... }

    // less bad; not explicitely restricted because of the 'var' keyword
    // but still restricted to local scope because of synxtax
    // still breaks many things
    function createStoryJS(){ ... }

    // good; function can be shared between files
    createStoryJS = function (){ ... }
    ````

Note:  I'm being judgemental here, and saying certain approaches are 'good' and 'bad', which implies certain ways of coding things.  If you're used to using ``private`` and ``public`` keywords, you'll note that the ``var`` keyword acts like ``private``, and can be useful for encapsulation and preventing internal variables from being shared with outside scopes.  That's a good thing.   Proper encapsulation and scoping should be encouraged.  But for people debugging applications and trying to integrate 3rd party libraries, the default usage of the ``var`` keyword breaks a lot of things, and the bottom line is that they generally need to bring some of the private variables into a more global context.
