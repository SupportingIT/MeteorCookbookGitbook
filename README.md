##Meteor Cookbook

Welcome to the Meteor Cookbook; a FAQ and tutorial culled and currated from over 12 months of emails and discussions from the [Meteor Talk](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/meteor-talk) google group and my experiences rolling out packages and apps.

These documents are intended for the intermediate user learning Meteor, who is accustomed to

- object-oriented frameworks and languages, such as Java and C#, and
- relational databases and data structures derived from SQL table schemas.

The focus is on helping the user grow accustomed to functional programming using document oriented databases.

The original work for this can be found on [Abigail Watson's](https://github.com/awatson1978) Github [repo](https://github.com/awatson1978/meteor-cookbook). Abigail is the author of the content, I have reorganized this content to fit easily into the GitBook format.
