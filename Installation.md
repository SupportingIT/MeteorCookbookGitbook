## Installation & Uninstallation

**Q:  Is there a Homebrew installer for Mac OSX?**
Unofficially, yes.  It can be found here:
https://gist.github.com/4317935

````
brew install https://gist.github.com/raw/4317935/05084353d3cd50acad7e88e01c3f6463b42c0ed3/meteor.rb
````

**Q:  Is there an MSI installer for Windows?**
Unofficially, yes. The last released version is 0.6.4.1. It can be found here:
http://win.meteor.com/

**Q:  When will Windows version become a first class citizen?**
Not in the immediate future, as it's slated to be included after the 1.0 release.  In the meantime, it's recommended to use a virtual machine for development.  You can read the roadmap and relevant disscussions here:

**Q:  How do I determine what version of Meteor is installed?**

Use the ``--version`` flag!  It's standard between Npm, Meteor, and Meteorite.
````sh
npm --version
meteor --version
mrt --version
````

**Q:  How do I run a specific version of Meteor?**

Use the ``--release`` flag!
````js
// for specifying meteor deployment target
meteor update --release 0.6.5

// for deployment
meteor bundle --release 0.6.5
````


**Q:  Should I install Npm with Node Version Manager?**
That's really up to you.  However, in my experience, it's been a bit more trouble than it's been worth.

````sh
# to check what version of NVM is installed
nvm ls
````

**Q:  How do I install and use a development branch of Meteor?**
There are two ways, depending if you're using meteor, or meteorite.  If using meteor:

````
cd
mkdir meteor.branchname
cd meteor.branchname
git clone https://github.com/username/meteor.git
cd <path to meteor project>
~/meteor.branchname/meteor/meteor
````

And, if you're using mrt:
````
{
  "meteor": {
    "meteor.branch": "branchname",
    "git": "https://github.com/username/meteor.git"
  }
}
````
**Q:  How do I uninstall Meteor?**
No need to run scripts.  Just delete directories like so:
````js
// the older location, pre 0.6.0
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/meteor

// the newer location, post 0.6.0
sudo rm -rf ~/.meteor
````
